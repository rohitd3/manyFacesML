            "content": "Pytorch is an extension of Python that is primarily used for developing machine learning frameworks and deep learning models. The Python syntax is mainly used to code. Pytorch integrates with CUDA that allows it to run well on GPUs. With GPU acceleration, Tensor computing(Like NumPy) is viable on Pytorch. Pytorch is used on various high level software, such as Tesla Autopilot, and Uber Pyro for starters. . Our Project . Our project is a surface level of Pytorch demonstration, and we intend to use it for our own learning purposes as well as yours. As you look through our code, we will try to supplement each segment with supporting blogs to explain as much as we can. .",

            "content": "What is test accuracy? . In PyTorch, the term &quot;test accuracy&quot; typically refers to the accuracy of a trained model on a separate test dataset. It&#39;s used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. Test accuracy measures how well the model generalizes to unseen data (data that the model hasn&#39;t interacted with or seen yet) . Importance of test accuracy . Through training, the model is able to learn in order to better its own accuracy. This is paramount to machine learning; in context of our project, the model&#39;s accuracy in being able to identify what certain images represent is what our project is based on . Imports . In this part of our project, we are importing the optim module from the pytorch library, which allows us to use optimization algorithms. We then define the loss function to be criterion, with the use of CrossEntropyLoss(), which is used for multi-class classification problems. Then we initialize the optimizer, with a learning rate of .001, and a momentum of .9. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration, and momentum helps accelerate convergence by considering previous gradients . import torch.optim as optim criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9) .

Underfitting and overfitting . Reasons for Underfitting: . High bias and low variance The size of the training dataset used is not enough. The model is too simple. Training data is not cleaned and also contains noise in it. . Techniques to reduce underfitting: . Increase model complexity Increase the number of features, performing feature engineering Remove noise from the data. Increase the number of epochs or increase the duration of training to get better results. . https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/underfitting-and-overfitting-in-machine-learning/# . This shows a training loop for a machine learning model and then calls the make_loss_graph function to visualize the training and validation loss per epoch.

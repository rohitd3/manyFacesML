    "Pytorch is an extension of Python that is primarily used for developing machine learning frameworks and deep learning models. The Python syntax is mainly used to code. Pytorch integrates with CUDA that allows it to run well on GPUs. With GPU acceleration, Tensor computing(Like NumPy) is viable on Pytorch. Pytorch is used on various high level software, such as Tesla Autopilot, and Uber Pyro for starters. \n"
